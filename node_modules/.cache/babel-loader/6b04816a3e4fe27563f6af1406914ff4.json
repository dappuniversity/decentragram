AES defines\n * its own methods of addition and multiplication but keeps some important\n * properties the same, ie: associativity and distributivity. The\n * explanation below tries to shed some light on how AES defines addition\n * and multiplication of bytes and 32-bit words in order to perform its\n * encryption and decryption algorithms.\n *\n * The basics:\n *\n * The AES algorithm views bytes as binary representations of polynomials\n * that have either 1 or 0 as the coefficients. It defines the addition\n * or subtraction of two bytes as the XOR operation. It also defines the\n * multiplication of two bytes as a finite field referred to as GF(2^8)\n * (Note: 'GF' means \"Galois Field\" which is a field that contains a finite\n * number of elements so GF(2^8) has 256 elements).\n *\n * This means that any two bytes can be represented as binary polynomials;\n * when they multiplied together and modularly reduced by an irreducible\n * polynomial of the 8th degree, the results are the field GF(2^8). The\n * specific irreducible polynomial that AES uses in hexadecimal is 0x11b.\n * This multiplication is associative with 0x01 as the identity:\n *\n * (b * 0x01 = GF(b, 0x01) = b).\n *\n * The operation GF(b, 0x02) can be performed at the byte level by left\n * shifting b once and then XOR'ing it (to perform the modular reduction)\n * with 0x11b if b is >= 128. Repeated application of the multiplication\n * of 0x02 can be used to implement the multiplication of any two bytes.\n *\n * For instance, multiplying 0x57 and 0x13, denoted as GF(0x57, 0x13), can\n * be performed by factoring 0x13 into 0x01, 0x02, and 0x10. Then these\n * factors can each be multiplied by 0x57 and then added together. To do\n * the multiplication, values for 0x57 multiplied by each of these 3 factors\n * can be precomputed and stored in a table. To add them, the values from\n * the table are XOR'd together.\n *\n * AES also defines addition and multiplication of words, that is 4-byte\n * numbers represented as polynomials of 3 degrees where the coefficients\n * are the values of the bytes.\n *\n * The word [a0, a1, a2, a3] is a polynomial a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0.\n *\n * Addition is performed by XOR'ing like powers of x. Multiplication\n * is performed in two steps, the first is an algebriac expansion as\n * you would do normally (where addition is XOR). But the result is\n * a polynomial larger than 3 degrees and thus it cannot fit in a word. So\n * next the result is modularly reduced by an AES-specific polynomial of\n * degree 4 which will always produce a polynomial of less than 4 degrees\n * such that it will fit in a word. In AES, this polynomial is x^4 + 1.\n *\n * The modular product of two polynomials 'a' and 'b' is thus:\n *\n * d(x) = d3x^3 + d2x^2 + d1x + d0\n * with\n * d0 = GF(a0, b0) ^ GF(a3, b1) ^ GF(a2, b2) ^ GF(a1, b3)\n * d1 = GF(a1, b0) ^ GF(a0, b1) ^ GF(a3, b2) ^ GF(a2, b3)\n * d2 = GF(a2, b0) ^ GF(a1, b1) ^ GF(a0, b2) ^ GF(a3, b3)\n * d3 = GF(a3, b0) ^ GF(a2, b1) ^ GF(a1, b2) ^ GF(a0, b3)\n *\n * As a matrix:\n *\n * [d0] = [a0 a3 a2 a1][b0]\n * [d1]   [a1 a0 a3 a2][b1]\n * [d2]   [a2 a1 a0 a3][b2]\n * [d3]   [a3 a2 a1 a0][b3]\n *\n * Special polynomials defined by AES (0x02 == {02}):\n * a(x)    = {03}x^3 + {01}x^2 + {01}x + {02}\n * a^-1(x) = {0b}x^3 + {0d}x^2 + {09}x + {0e}.\n *\n * These polynomials are used in the MixColumns() and InverseMixColumns()\n * operations, respectively, to cause each element in the state to affect\n * the output (referred to as diffusing).\n *\n * RotWord() uses: a0 = a1 = a2 = {00} and a3 = {01}, which is the\n * polynomial x3.\n *\n * The ShiftRows() method modifies the last 3 rows in the state (where\n * the state is 4 words with 4 bytes per word) by shifting bytes cyclically.\n * The 1st byte in the second row is moved to the end of the row. The 1st\n * and 2nd bytes in the third row are moved to the end of the row. The 1st,\n * 2nd, and 3rd bytes are moved in the fourth row.\n *\n * More details on how AES arithmetic works:\n *\n * In the polynomial representation of binary numbers, XOR performs addition\n * and subtraction and multiplication in GF(2^8) denoted as GF(a, b)\n * corresponds with the multiplication of polynomials modulo an irreducible\n * polynomial of degree 8. In other words, for AES, GF(a, b) will multiply\n * polynomial 'a' with polynomial 'b' and then do a modular reduction by\n * an AES-specific irreducible polynomial of degree 8.\n *\n * A polynomial is irreducible if its only divisors are one and itself. For\n * the AES algorithm, this irreducible polynomial is:\n *\n * m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1,\n *\n * or {01}{1b} in hexadecimal notation, where each coefficient is a bit:\n * 100011011 = 283 = 0x11b.\n *\n * For example, GF(0x57, 0x83) = 0xc1 because\n *\n * 0x57 = 87  = 01010111 = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1\n * 0x85 = 131 = 10000101 = x^7 + x + 1\n *\n * (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) * (x^7 + x + 1)\n * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 +\n *    x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x +\n *    x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1\n * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1 = y\n *    y modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)\n * =  x^7 + x^6 + 1.\n *\n * The modular reduction by m(x) guarantees the result will be a binary\n * polynomial of less than degree 8, so that it can fit in a byte.\n *\n * The operation to multiply a binary polynomial b with x (the polynomial\n * x in binary representation is 00000010) is:\n *\n * b_7x^8 + b_6x^7 + b_5x^6 + b_4x^5 + b_3x^4 + b_2x^3 + b_1x^2 + b_0x^1\n *\n * To get GF(b, x) we must reduce that by m(x). If b_7 is 0 (that is the\n * most significant bit is 0 in b) then the result is already reduced. If\n * it is 1, then we can reduce it by subtracting m(x) via an XOR.\n *\n * It follows that multiplication by x (00000010 or 0x02) can be implemented\n * by performing a left shift followed by a conditional bitwise XOR with\n * 0x1b. This operation on bytes is denoted by xtime(). Multiplication by\n * higher powers of x can be implemented by repeated application of xtime().\n *\n * By adding intermediate results, multiplication by any constant can be\n * implemented. For instance:\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x13) = 0xfe because:\n *\n * xtime(b) = (b & 128) ? (b << 1 ^ 0x11b) : (b << 1)\n *\n * Note: We XOR with 0x11b instead of 0x1b because in javascript our\n * datatype for b can be larger than 1 byte, so a left shift will not\n * automatically eliminate bits that overflow a byte ... by XOR'ing the\n * overflow bit with 1 (the extra one from 0x11b) we zero it out.\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x02) = xtime(0x57) = 0xae\n * GF(0x57, 0x04) = xtime(0xae) = 0x47\n * GF(0x57, 0x08) = xtime(0x47) = 0x8e\n * GF(0x57, 0x10) = xtime(0x8e) = 0x07\n *\n * GF(0x57, 0x13) = GF(0x57, (0x01 ^ 0x02 ^ 0x10))\n *\n * And by the distributive property (since XOR is addition and GF() is\n * multiplication):\n *\n * = GF(0x57, 0x01) ^ GF(0x57, 0x02) ^ GF(0x57, 0x10)\n * = 0x57 ^ 0xae ^ 0x07\n * = 0xfe.\n */\n\nfunction initialize() {\n  init = true;\n  /* Populate the Rcon table.

There are many\n      generators (128 out of 256): 3,5,6,9,11,82 to name a few. To fully\n      traverse GF we iterate 255 times, multiplying by our generator\n      each time.\n       On each iteration we can determine the multiplicative inverse for\n      the current element.\n       Suppose there is an element in GF 'e'. For a given generator 'g',\n      e = g^x. The multiplicative inverse of e is g^(255 - x). It turns\n      out that if use the inverse of a generator as another generator\n      it will produce all of the corresponding multiplicative inverses\n      at the same time. For this reason, we choose 5 as our inverse\n      generator because it only requires 2 multiplies and 1 add and its\n      inverse, 82, requires relatively few operations as well.\n       In order to apply the affine transformation, the multiplicative\n      inverse 'ei' of 'e' can be repeatedly XOR'd (4 times) with a\n      bit-cycling of 'ei'. To do this 'ei' is first stored in 's' and\n      'x'. Then 's' is left shifted and the high bit of 's' is made the\n      low bit. The resulting value is stored in 's'. Then 'x' is XOR'd\n      with 's' and stored in 'x'. On each subsequent iteration the same\n      operation is performed. When 4 iterations are complete, 'x' is\n      XOR'd with 'c' (0x63) and the transformed value is stored in 'x'.\n      For example:\n       s = 01000001\n      x = 01000001\n       iteration 1: s = 10000010, x ^= s\n      iteration 2: s = 00000101, x ^= s\n      iteration 3: s = 00001010, x ^= s\n      iteration 4: s = 00010100, x ^= s\n      x ^= 0x63\n       This can be done with a loop where s = (s << 1) | (s >> 7). However,\n      it can also be done by using a single 16-bit (in this case 32-bit)\n      number 'sx'. Since XOR is an associative operation, we can set 'sx'\n      to 'ei' and then XOR it with 'sx' left-shifted 1,2,3, and 4 times.\n      The most significant bits will flow into the high 8 bit positions\n      and be correctly XOR'd with one another. All that remains will be\n      to cycle the high 8 bits by XOR'ing them all with the lower 8 bits\n      afterwards.\n       At the same time we're populating sbox and isbox we can precompute\n      the multiplication we'll need to do to do MixColumns() later.\n    */\n    // apply affine transformation\n    sx = ei ^ ei << 1 ^ ei << 2 ^ ei << 3 ^ ei << 4;\n    sx = sx >> 8 ^ sx & 255 ^ 0x63; // update tables\n\n    sbox[e] = sx;\n    isbox[sx] = e;\n    /* Mixing columns is done using matrix multiplication. The columns\n      that are to be mixed are each a single word in the current state.\n      The state has Nb columns (4 columns). Therefore each column is a\n      4 byte word. So to mix the columns in a single column 'c' where\n      its rows are r0, r1, r2, and r3, we use the following matrix\n      multiplication:\n       [2 3 1 1]*[r0,c]=[r'0,c]\n      [1 2 3 1] [r1,c] [r'1,c]\n      [1 1 2 3] [r2,c] [r'2,c]\n      [3 1 1 2] [r3,c] [r'3,c]\n       r0, r1, r2, and r3 are each 1 byte of one of the words in the\n      state (a column). To do matrix multiplication for each mixed\n      column c' we multiply the corresponding row from the left matrix\n      with the corresponding column from the right matrix. In total, we\n      get 4 equations:\n       r0,c' = 2*r0,c + 3*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 1*r3,c\n      r1,c' = 1*r0,c + 2*r1,c + 3*r2,c + 1*r3,c\n      r2,c' = 1*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 2*r2,c + 3*r3,c\n      r3,c' = 3*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 2*r3,c\n       As usual, the multiplication is as previously defined and the\n      addition is XOR. In order to optimize mixing columns we can store\n      the multiplication results in tables. If you think of the whole\n      column as a word (it might help to visualize by mentally rotating\n      the equations above by counterclockwise 90 degrees) then you can\n      see that it would be useful to map the multiplications performed on\n      each byte (r0, r1, r2, r3) onto a word as well. For instance, we\n      could map 2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0 onto a word by storing 2*r0 in the\n      highest 8 bits and 3*r0 in the lowest 8 bits (with the other two\n      respectively in the middle). This means that a table can be\n      constructed that uses r0 as an index to the word. We can do the\n      same with r1, r2, and r3, creating a total of 4 tables.\n       To construct a full c', we can just look up each byte of c in\n      their respective tables and XOR the results together.\n       Also, to build each table we only have to calculate the word\n      for 2,1,1,3 for every byte ... which we can do on each iteration\n      of this loop since we will iterate over every byte. After we have\n      calculated 2,1,1,3 we can get the results for the other tables\n      by cycling the byte at the end to the beginning. For instance\n      we can take the result of table 2,1,1,3 and produce table 3,2,1,1\n      by moving the right most byte to the left most position just like\n      how you can imagine the 3 moved out of 2,1,1,3 and to the front\n      to produce 3,2,1,1.\n       There is another optimization in that the same multiples of\n      the current element we need in order to advance our generator\n      to the next iteration can be reused in performing the 2,1,1,3\n      calculation. We also calculate the inverse mix column tables,\n      with e,9,d,b being the inverse of 2,1,1,3.\n       When we're done, and we need to actually mix columns, the first\n      byte of each state word should be put through mix[0] (2,1,1,3),\n      the second through mix[1] (3,2,1,1) and so forth. Then they should\n      be XOR'd together to produce the fully mixed column.\n    */\n    // calculate mix and imix table values\n\n    sx2 = xtime[sx];\n    e2 = xtime[e];\n    e4 = xtime[e2];\n    e8 = xtime[e4];\n    me = sx2 << 24 ^ // 2\n    sx << 16 ^ // 1\n    sx << 8 ^ ( // 1\n    sx ^ sx2); // 3\n\n    ime = (e2 ^ e4 ^ e8) << 24 ^ // E (14)\n    (e ^ e8) << 16 ^ // 9\n    (e ^ e4 ^ e8) << 8 ^ ( // D (13)\n    e ^ e2 ^ e8); // B (11)\n    // produce each of the mix tables by rotating the 2,1,1,3 value\n\n    for (var n = 0; n < 4; ++n) {\n      mix[n][e] = me;\n      imix[n][sx] = ime; // cycle the right most byte to the left most position\n      // ie: 2,1,1,3 becomes 3,2,1,1\n\n      me = me << 24 | me >>> 8;\n      ime = ime << 24 | ime >>> 8;\n    } // get next element and inverse\n\n\n    if (e === 0) {\n      // 1 is the inverse of 1\n      e = ei = 1;\n    } else {\n      // e = 2e + 2*2*2*(10e)) = multiply e by 82 (chosen generator)\n      // ei = ei + 2*2*ei = multiply ei by 5 (inverse generator)\n      e = e2 ^ xtime[xtime[xtime[e2 ^ e8]]];\n      ei ^= xtime[xtime[ei]];\n    }\n  }\n}\n/**\n * Generates a key schedule using the AES key expansion algorithm.\n *\n * The AES algorithm takes the Cipher Key, K, and performs a Key Expansion\n * routine to generate a key schedule.

However, because there\n     are differences in the decryption algorithm, other than just swapping\n     in different look up tables, we must transform our key schedule to\n     account for these changes:\n      1. The decryption algorithm gets its key rounds in reverse order.\n     2. The decryption algorithm adds the round key before mixing columns\n       instead of afterwards.\n      We don't need to modify our key schedule to handle the first case,\n     we can just traverse the key schedule in reverse order when decrypting.\n      The second case requires a little work.\n      The tables we built for performing rounds will take an input and then\n     perform SubBytes() and MixColumns() or, for the decrypt version,\n     InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns(). But the decrypt algorithm requires\n     us to AddRoundKey() before InvMixColumns(). This means we'll need to\n     apply some transformations to the round key to inverse-mix its columns\n     so they'll be correct for moving AddRoundKey() to after the state has\n     had its columns inverse-mixed.\n      To inverse-mix the columns of the state when we're decrypting we use a\n     lookup table that will apply InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns() at the\n     same time. However, the round key's bytes are not inverse-substituted\n     in the decryption algorithm. To get around this problem, we can first\n     substitute the bytes in the round key so that when we apply the\n     transformation via the InvSubBytes()+InvMixColumns() table, it will\n     undo our substitution leaving us with the original value that we\n     want -- and then inverse-mix that value.\n      This change will correctly alter our key schedule so that we can XOR\n     each round key with our already transformed decryption state. This\n     allows us to use the same code path as the encryption algorithm.\n      We make one more change to the decryption key. Since the decryption\n     algorithm runs in reverse from the encryption algorithm, we reverse\n     the order of the round keys to avoid having to iterate over the key\n     schedule backwards when running the encryption algorithm later in\n     decryption mode. In addition to reversing the order of the round keys,\n     we also swap each round key's 2nd and 4th rows. See the comments\n     section where rounds are performed for more details about why this is\n     done.

The important distinction is\n      that the columns are cycling, with c0 being used with the m0\n      map when calculating c0, but c1 being used with the m0 map when\n      calculating c1 ... and so forth.\n       When performing the inverse we transform the mirror image and\n      skip the bottom row, instead of the top one, and move upwards:\n       c3 c2 c1 c0 => c0 c3 c2 c1  (cycled 3 bytes) *same as encryption\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c1 c0 c3 c2  (cycled 2 bytes)\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c2 c1 c0 c3  (cycled 1 byte)  *same as encryption\n      c3 c2 c1 c0    c3 c2 c1 c0\n       If you compare the resulting matrices for ShiftRows()+MixColumns()\n      and for InvShiftRows()+InvMixColumns() the 2nd and 4th columns are\n      different (in encrypt mode vs. decrypt mode). So in order to use\n      the same code to handle both encryption and decryption, we will\n      need to do some mapping.\n       If in encryption mode we let a=c0, b=c1, c=c2, d=c3, and r<N> be\n      a row number in the state, then the resulting matrix in encryption\n      mode for applying the above transformations would be:\n       r1: a b c d\n      r2: b c d a\n      r3: c d a b\n      r4: d a b c\n       If we did the same in decryption mode we would get:\n       r1: a d c b\n      r2: b a d c\n      r3: c b a d\n      r4: d c b a\n       If instead we swap d and b (set b=c3 and d=c1), then we get:\n       r1: a b c d\n      r2: d a b c\n      r3: c d a b\n      r4: b c d a\n       Now the 1st and 3rd rows are the same as the encryption matrix. All\n      we need to do then to make the mapping exactly the same is to swap\n      the 2nd and 4th rows when in decryption mode. To do this without\n      having to do it on each iteration, we swapped the 2nd and 4th rows\n      in the decryption key schedule. We also have to do the swap above\n      when we first pull in the input and when we set the final output. */\n    a2 = m0[a >>> 24] ^ m1[b >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[c >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[d & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    b2 = m0[b >>> 24] ^ m1[c >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[d >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[a & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    c2 = m0[c >>> 24] ^ m1[d >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[a >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[b & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    d = m0[d >>> 24] ^ m1[a >>> 16 & 255] ^ m2[b >>> 8 & 255] ^ m3[c & 255] ^ w[++i];\n    a = a2;\n    b = b2;\n    c = c2;\n  }\n  /*\n    Encrypt:\n    SubBytes(state)\n    ShiftRows(state)\n    AddRoundKey(state, w[Nr*Nb, (Nr+1)*Nb-1])\n     Decrypt:\n    InvShiftRows(state)\n    InvSubBytes(state)\n    AddRoundKey(state, w[0, Nb-1])\n   */\n  // Note: rows are shifted inline\n\n\n  output[0] = sub[a >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[b >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[c >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[d & 255] ^ w[++i];\n  output[decrypt ? 3 : 1] = sub[b >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[c >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[d >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[a & 255] ^ w[++i];\n  output[2] = sub[c >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[d >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[a >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[b & 255] ^ w[++i];\n  output[decrypt ? 1 : 3] = sub[d >>> 24] << 24 ^ sub[a >>> 16 & 255] << 16 ^ sub[b >>> 8 & 255] << 8 ^ sub[c & 255] ^ w[++i];\n}\n/**\n * Deprecated.
